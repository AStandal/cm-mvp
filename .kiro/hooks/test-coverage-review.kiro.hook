Are there any other tests that should be added to increase test scope in a meaningful way?\n\nConsider:\n- Edge cases and error conditions\n- Integration points between components\n- Business logic validation\n- User interaction flows\n- API endpoint coverage\n- Data validation and transformation\n- Performance and scalability concerns\n\nProvide specific recommendations for additional tests that would meaningfully improve the test suite."
