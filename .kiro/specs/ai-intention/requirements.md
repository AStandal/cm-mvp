# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-intention system provides a generalized framework for sending prompts and context to Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured output deserialization. The system enables automated processing of documents (such as PDFs) through configurable intention handlers that define prompts, input processing logic, and output data models. The initial implementation focuses on two specific use cases in public city planning: extracting zoning plan requirements from documents and evaluating building permit applications against those requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a city planning administrator, I want to extract structured zoning requirements from PDF documents, so that I can automate the creation of requirement checklists for building permits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a zoning plan PDF is provided THEN the system SHALL extract structured requirements data using AI analysis
2. WHEN the AI processes the zoning plan THEN the system SHALL deserialize the JSON response into structured data models
3. WHEN requirements are extracted THEN the system SHALL store them in a format suitable for permit evaluation
4. IF the PDF cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN multiple zoning plan documents are provided THEN the system SHALL process them from a specified folder location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a city planning administrator, I want to evaluate building permit applications against zoning requirements, so that I can automatically identify compliance issues and approval status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a building permit application and zoning requirements are provided THEN the system SHALL evaluate each requirement against the application
2. WHEN evaluating requirements THEN the system SHALL return a structured response indicating compliance status for each requirement
3. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail status with explanatory details
4. IF evaluation cannot be completed THEN the system SHALL return specific error information
5. WHEN multiple permit applications need evaluation THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently in batch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configurable intention handler framework, so that I can easily create new AI-powered document processing workflows beyond city planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new intention handler THEN the system SHALL provide a clear interface for defining prompts, input processing, and output models
2. WHEN an intention handler is registered THEN the system SHALL validate its configuration and data models
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate handler based on intention type
4. IF a handler configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent registration and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN extending the system THEN developers SHALL be able to add new intention types without modifying core framework code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable document processing with proper error handling, so that I can trust the system to handle various document formats and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDF documents THEN the system SHALL extract text content reliably
2. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff strategies
3. WHEN JSON deserialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
4. IF document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return clear format error messages
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL handle processing queues appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints for intention processing, so that I can integrate AI-powered document analysis into external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting documents for processing THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON responses
3. WHEN processing takes time THEN the system SHALL provide status endpoints for tracking progress
4. IF API requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without conflicts
