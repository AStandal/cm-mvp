# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates generative AI functionality into a case management system to streamline the application processing workflow. The system will support a three-stage process: receiving applications, case managing applications, and concluding applications. At every process step, users will have access to comprehensive AI summaries and step-specific recommendations to increase quality and efficiency. The system will maintain a robust data model to support future dashboard and reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to receive and automatically process new applications with comprehensive AI analysis, so that I can quickly understand the application details and receive specific recommendations for next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new application is submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new case record with unique identifier
2. WHEN an application is received THEN the system SHALL extract and store key application data (applicant info, application type, submission date)
3. WHEN an application is processed THEN the AI SHALL generate a comprehensive overall case summary highlighting key points and potential issues
4. WHEN an application is processed THEN the AI SHALL generate specific recommendations for the "Receive Application" step including suggested actions and priority level
5. IF an application contains incomplete information THEN the system SHALL flag missing required fields with AI-suggested follow-up actions
6. WHEN a case is created THEN the system SHALL set the initial status to "Received" and log the creation timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to manage cases through their lifecycle with comprehensive AI assistance at each step, so that I can make informed decisions and efficiently progress cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a case THEN the system SHALL display the overall AI-generated case summary that is continuously updated throughout the process
2. WHEN in the "Case Management" step THEN the AI SHALL provide specific recommendations for case management actions including next steps, required documentation, and potential issues
3. WHEN case status changes THEN the system SHALL update the status, log the change with timestamp and user, and regenerate relevant AI summaries
4. WHEN adding case notes THEN the system SHALL allow manual notes and automatically update the overall AI case summary to incorporate new information
5. WHEN reviewing case progress THEN the AI SHALL provide step-specific insights and recommendations based on current case state and historical data
6. IF a case requires additional documentation THEN the system SHALL track outstanding requirements with AI-suggested follow-up actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to conclude cases with comprehensive AI analysis and step-specific recommendations, so that I can ensure proper case closure and maintain accurate records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering the "Conclude Application" step THEN the AI SHALL provide specific recommendations for case conclusion including suggested decision and supporting rationale
2. WHEN concluding a case THEN the AI SHALL generate a comprehensive final case summary including key decisions, outcomes, and process history
3. WHEN a case is ready for conclusion THEN the system SHALL verify all required steps have been completed with AI validation of completeness
4. WHEN closing a case THEN the system SHALL require a final decision status (approved, denied, withdrawn, etc.) with AI-generated decision support
5. WHEN a case is concluded THEN the system SHALL generate final documentation and archive the case with updated overall AI summary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want a comprehensive data model that captures all case information and AI interactions, so that future dashboard and reporting capabilities can be built efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing case data THEN the system SHALL maintain a structured data model that includes case metadata, status history, and timeline information
2. WHEN AI generates summaries or recommendations THEN the system SHALL store these with timestamps, step context, and version information, including the underlying prompts that were used for the generation for future prompt improvements and evaluations.
3. WHEN case activities occur THEN the system SHALL log all user actions, status changes, and AI interactions with full audit trail
4. WHEN querying case data THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval of cases by status, date ranges, case type, and other key attributes
5. WHEN storing AI-generated content THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between overall summaries, step-specific recommendations, and source data
6. IF the system needs to support reporting THEN the data model SHALL enable aggregation and analysis of case metrics, processing times, and AI usage patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ability to configure and switch between different LLM models for AI processing, so that I can optimize performance, cost, and capabilities based on organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers through OpenRouter's unified API including Grok, GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and other supported models
2. WHEN switching LLM models THEN the system SHALL allow runtime configuration changes without requiring application restart through a model management interface
3. WHEN using different models THEN the system SHALL track which specific model was used for each AI interaction including model version and provider for audit and performance analysis
4. WHEN a model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to a configured backup model with appropriate logging and user notification
5. WHEN generating AI content THEN the system SHALL support model-specific parameters and configurations (temperature, max tokens, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty) through OpenRouter's API
6. IF cost optimization is required THEN the system SHALL support routing different AI operations to different models based on complexity, cost per token, and performance requirements
7. WHEN model performance varies THEN the system SHALL log response times, token usage, costs per model, and success rates for optimization analysis and reporting
8. WHEN integrating with OpenRouter THEN the system SHALL utilize OpenRouter's real-time pricing, model availability status, and provider fallback capabilities
9. WHEN managing costs THEN the system SHALL implement spending limits, usage alerts, and cost tracking per model through OpenRouter's billing integration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model and prompt evaluation tools to benchmark AI functionality, so that I can create better prompts, optimize model selection, and improve AI response quality based on user feedback and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating AI performance THEN the system SHALL support creating evaluation datasets with ground truth examples for different AI operations (summaries, recommendations, analysis)
2. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL execute the same prompts across multiple models and configurations to compare performance
3. WHEN collecting feedback THEN the system SHALL allow users to rate AI-generated content (summaries, recommendations) with thumbs up/down and detailed feedback
4. WHEN analyzing prompt performance THEN the system SHALL track metrics including response quality scores, user satisfaction ratings, response time, and token efficiency
5. WHEN optimizing prompts THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing different prompt templates and configurations against the same input data
6. WHEN benchmarking models THEN the system SHALL generate comparative reports showing model performance across different metrics (accuracy, cost, speed, user satisfaction)
7. WHEN improving AI quality THEN the system SHALL provide tools to analyze failed or low-rated responses to identify prompt improvement opportunities
8. IF evaluation data exists THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal model and prompt configurations based on historical performance data
9. WHEN tracking AI evolution THEN the system SHALL maintain version history of prompts and models with performance metrics over time
10. WHEN evaluation AI performance THEN the system SHALL support using separate language models to do the qualitative evaluation of the AI functionality results
