# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates generative AI functionality into a case management system to streamline the application processing workflow. The system will support a three-stage process: receiving applications, case managing applications, and concluding applications. At every process step, users will have access to comprehensive AI summaries and step-specific recommendations to increase quality and efficiency. The system will maintain a robust data model to support future dashboard and reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to receive and automatically process new applications with comprehensive AI analysis, so that I can quickly understand the application details and receive specific recommendations for next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new application is submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new case record with unique identifier
2. WHEN an application is received THEN the system SHALL extract and store key application data (applicant info, application type, submission date)
3. WHEN an application is processed THEN the AI SHALL generate a comprehensive overall case summary highlighting key points and potential issues
4. WHEN an application is processed THEN the AI SHALL generate specific recommendations for the "Receive Application" step including suggested actions and priority level
5. IF an application contains incomplete information THEN the system SHALL flag missing required fields with AI-suggested follow-up actions
6. WHEN a case is created THEN the system SHALL set the initial status to "Received" and log the creation timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to manage cases through their lifecycle with comprehensive AI assistance at each step, so that I can make informed decisions and efficiently progress cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a case THEN the system SHALL display the overall AI-generated case summary that is continuously updated throughout the process
2. WHEN in the "Case Management" step THEN the AI SHALL provide specific recommendations for case management actions including next steps, required documentation, and potential issues
3. WHEN case status changes THEN the system SHALL update the status, log the change with timestamp and user, and regenerate relevant AI summaries
4. WHEN adding case notes THEN the system SHALL allow manual notes and automatically update the overall AI case summary to incorporate new information
5. WHEN reviewing case progress THEN the AI SHALL provide step-specific insights and recommendations based on current case state and historical data
6. IF a case requires additional documentation THEN the system SHALL track outstanding requirements with AI-suggested follow-up actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a case manager, I want to conclude cases with comprehensive AI analysis and step-specific recommendations, so that I can ensure proper case closure and maintain accurate records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering the "Conclude Application" step THEN the AI SHALL provide specific recommendations for case conclusion including suggested decision and supporting rationale
2. WHEN concluding a case THEN the AI SHALL generate a comprehensive final case summary including key decisions, outcomes, and process history
3. WHEN a case is ready for conclusion THEN the system SHALL verify all required steps have been completed with AI validation of completeness
4. WHEN closing a case THEN the system SHALL require a final decision status (approved, denied, withdrawn, etc.) with AI-generated decision support
5. WHEN a case is concluded THEN the system SHALL generate final documentation and archive the case with updated overall AI summary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want a comprehensive data model that captures all case information and AI interactions, so that future dashboard and reporting capabilities can be built efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing case data THEN the system SHALL maintain a structured data model that includes case metadata, status history, and timeline information
2. WHEN AI generates summaries or recommendations THEN the system SHALL store these with timestamps, step context, and version information, including the underlying prompts that were used for the generation for future prompt improvements and evaluations.
3. WHEN case activities occur THEN the system SHALL log all user actions, status changes, and AI interactions with full audit trail
4. WHEN querying case data THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval of cases by status, date ranges, case type, and other key attributes
5. WHEN storing AI-generated content THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between overall summaries, step-specific recommendations, and source data
6. IF the system needs to support reporting THEN the data model SHALL enable aggregation and analysis of case metrics, processing times, and AI usage patterns
