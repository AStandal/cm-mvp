# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI evaluation framework MVP to ensure high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in the case management system. The framework will capture all AI interactions with comprehensive metadata, provide LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation capabilities with score-based assessment, and support A/B testing for prompt optimization. This foundational system will enable data-driven improvement of AI quality through systematic evaluation and experimentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to capture and store all AI interactions with comprehensive metadata, so that I can build evaluation datasets and track AI performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI operation is performed THEN the system SHALL capture and store the complete interaction including input data, prompt templates, context, model used, parameters, output, timestamps, and user session information
2. WHEN storing AI interactions THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as operation type (summary, recommendation, analysis), case context, processing time, token usage, cost information, success rates, and error frequencies
3. WHEN AI interactions are logged THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and support efficient querying by date range, operation type, model, user, and performance metrics
4. WHEN capturing prompts THEN the system SHALL store the exact prompt template version, variables used, and final rendered prompt for reproducibility
5. IF an AI operation fails THEN the system SHALL log error details, retry attempts, fallback actions, and failure reasons for analysis
6. WHEN storing outputs THEN the system SHALL preserve the raw AI response, parsed structured data, and any post-processing transformations applied
7. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL monitor and store response times, token usage, cost per operation, success rates, and error frequencies across different models and operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want to implement LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation capabilities with score-based assessment, so that I can automatically assess AI output quality at scale with consistent criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring LLM-as-a-Judge THEN the system SHALL support multiple evaluation models (GPT-4, Claude, Grok) with configurable scoring criteria and prompt templates
2. WHEN evaluating AI outputs THEN the system SHALL use score-based evaluation format (1-10 scale) with detailed reasoning for each score
3. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL implement bias mitigation techniques including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot examples from captured data
4. WHEN scoring outputs THEN the system SHALL evaluate multiple dimensions including faithfulness, completeness, relevance, clarity, and task-specific criteria (e.g., missing information detection accuracy)
5. IF evaluation results show low scores THEN the system SHALL flag outputs for review and provide detailed reasoning traces for improvement insights
6. WHEN batch evaluating THEN the system SHALL support processing multiple outputs efficiently with cost tracking and rate limiting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want A/B testing and prompt optimization capabilities, so that I can systematically improve AI quality through controlled experimentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up A/B tests THEN the system SHALL support testing different prompt templates, model configurations, and parameter settings against the same input data with statistical significance tracking
2. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL randomly assign users or cases to different AI configurations while maintaining consistent evaluation criteria across test groups
3. WHEN collecting A/B test data THEN the system SHALL track user satisfaction ratings, task completion rates, and quality scores for each experimental condition
4. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis including confidence intervals, p-values, and effect sizes to determine significant improvements
5. IF A/B tests show significant quality improvements THEN the system SHALL support gradual rollout of winning configurations with rollback capabilities
6. WHEN optimizing prompts THEN the system SHALL maintain version control of all prompt templates and track performance changes over iterations
