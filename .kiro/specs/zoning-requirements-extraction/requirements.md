## Introduksjon

The zoning requirements extraction feature enables automated extraction of structured zoning plan requirements from PDF documents using AI analysis. This feature integrates with the existing AIService, DataService, and PromptTemplateService to provide document processing capabilities for city planning workflows. The system will extract zoning requirements, store them in the database, and make them available for building permit evaluation processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a city planning administrator, I want to upload zoning plan PDF documents and extract structured requirements data, so that I can create standardized requirement checklists for building permit evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a zoning plan PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content from the PDF document
2. WHEN the PDF text is processed THEN the system SHALL send the content to OpenRouter LLM services for AI analysis
3. WHEN the LLM processes the content THEN the system SHALL receive structured JSON responses containing identified zoning requirements
4. WHEN LLM responses are received THEN the system SHALL deserialize the JSON into structured data models representing zoning requirements
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL store the structured requirements data in the database with proper relationships
6. IF the PDF cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages with failure details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a city planning administrator, I want to process multiple zoning plan documents from a folder location, so that I can efficiently extract requirements from large document sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a folder path is provided THEN the system SHALL identify all PDF files in the specified directory
2. WHEN processing multiple documents THEN the system SHALL process each PDF file sequentially with proper error handling
3. WHEN batch processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of successful and failed extractions
4. IF individual documents fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining documents and report specific failures
5. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and status updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the zoning requirements extraction to integrate seamlessly with existing services, so that the feature follows established patterns and maintains system consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing document processing THEN the system SHALL extend the existing AIService with new methods for zoning document analysis
2. WHEN creating AI prompts THEN the system SHALL use the existing PromptTemplateService pattern for zoning requirements extraction templates
3. WHEN making LLM requests THEN the system SHALL use the existing OpenRouterClient for API communication
4. WHEN storing extracted data THEN the system SHALL use the existing DataService for database operations and structured data persistence
5. WHEN logging operations THEN the system SHALL follow existing AIInteraction logging patterns for audit trails
6. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use established error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and validation for document processing, so that the system handles various document formats and edge cases reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDF documents THEN the system SHALL validate file format and readability before processing
2. WHEN OpenRouter LLM processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN JSON deserialization of LLM responses fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation error messages with schema mismatch details
4. IF document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return clear format validation errors
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL handle processing queues and rate limiting appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints for zoning requirements extraction, so that I can integrate document processing into external planning systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting documents for processing THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints following existing patterns
2. WHEN processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL return processing status and unique identifiers
3. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to retrieve structured requirements data
4. IF API requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses
5. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without resource conflicts
